## 🎯 Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Join-Heavy Architecture**

   - **Rationale**: Real-world applications require sophisticated data relationships
   - **Alternatives**: Denormalized single-table approach
   - **Trade-offs**: Query complexity for data integrity and normalization

2. **Subquery vs JOIN Preference**
   - **Decision**: Demonstrate both subqueries and JOINs for similar operations
   - **Rationale**: Show multiple approaches and their performance characteristics
   - **Alternatives**: Focus on single approach only
   - **Trade-offs**: Learning complexity for comprehensive understanding

### Known Limitations
- **Performance**: Complex queries may have high computational cost
- **Maintainability**: Advanced queries can be difficult to debug

### Future Considerations
- **Stored Procedures**: Advanced database programming capabilities
- **Triggers**: Automatic database event handling
