# Project Manifest: Python Input/Output

## Project Identity
- **Name**: Python Input/Output
- **Type**: Educational
- **Scope**: File Operations and Data Persistence
- **Status**: Completed

## Technology Signature
- **Core**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries**: json (built-in)
- **Documentation**: Docstrings (Google style)
- **Style Guide**: PEP 8

## Demonstrated Competencies
- File Handling Operations
- Reading and Writing Text Files
- Context Managers for Resource Management
- JSON Serialization and Deserialization
- Object Persistence Techniques
- Error Handling in File Operations
- Path Manipulation and File Access
- Data Format Conversion
- Memory Efficient File Processing
- Proper File Closing Practices

## System Context
This module builds upon the foundation of Python programming and object-oriented concepts, focusing on data persistence through file operations. It introduces techniques for storing and retrieving data from various file formats, particularly focusing on JSON serialization for object persistence. These skills are fundamental for many real-world applications including configuration management, data processing, and application state preservation.

## Development Requirements
- Python 3.8+ Interpreter
- Text Editor or IDE
- Access to File System
- Understanding of JSON Format
- Knowledge of Context Managers
- Error Handling Techniques

## Development Workflow
1. Understand the file operation to be implemented
2. Select appropriate file mode and access pattern
3. Implement the operation with proper error handling
4. Test with various file sizes and content
5. Ensure resources are properly closed
6. Document the functionality with clear docstrings
7. Verify PEP 8 compliance

## Maintenance Notes
- All file operations use context managers when possible
- Error handling is consistent across implementations
- File paths are validated before operations
- Large file operations consider memory efficiency
- JSON operations handle custom object types appropriately
- Docstrings provide clear usage examples

## Implementation Specifics

### Basic File Operations
- **Reading Files**: [0-read_file.py](./0-read_file.py), [1-write_file.py](./1-write_file.py), [2-append_write.py](./2-append_write.py)
- **Student to JSON**: [9-student.py](./9-student.py), [10-student.py](./10-student.py), [11-student.py](./11-student.py)
- **Pascal's Triangle**: [12-pascal_triangle.py](./12-pascal_triangle.py)

### JSON Operations
- **To JSON String**: [3-to_json_string.py](./3-to_json_string.py)
- **From JSON String**: [4-from_json_string.py](./4-from_json_string.py)
- **Save to JSON File**: [5-save_to_json_file.py](./5-save_to_json_file.py)
- **Load from JSON File**: [6-load_from_json_file.py](./6-load_from_json_file.py)
- **Add Items to JSON File**: [7-add_item.py](./7-add_item.py)
- **Class to JSON**: [8-class_to_json.py](./8-class_to_json.py)

### Advanced Operations
- **Search and Update**: [100-append_after.py](./100-append_after.py)
- **Log Parsing**: [101-stats.py](./101-stats.py)

## Learning Path Integration
- **Builds On**: Python Classes (0x06-0x08), Python Inheritance (0x0A)
- **Leads To**: Almost a Circle project (0x0C), which combines OOP, file I/O, and testing

## Assessment Criteria
- Correct implementation of file operations
- Proper use of context managers
- Effective JSON serialization/deserialization
- Appropriate error handling
- PEP 8 compliant code style
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Memory efficiency with large files
- Resource management (file handles)
